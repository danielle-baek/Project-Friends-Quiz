  {"Joey": "A fun-loving and loyal friend. You are kind, but could benefit from putting in a little more effort into the things you do.",
    "Monica": "The organiser of the group, you always pull your friends together by organising the activites down to the last detail. You can be a little pedantic about making sure everything is perfect and forget to enjoy the occasion.",
    "Phoebe": "A spiritual soul, you're also tough when you need to be. You can be hard on your friends who haven't been through the same struggles in life as you.",
    "Ross": "An academic, you strive for success. You are a loyal friend, but have a tendency not to think things through.",
    "Chandler": "You are a caring and kind friend. Always the clown, you sometimes use humour to disguise your insecurities.",
    "Rachel": "You know that good looks can get you far, but you are also driven to put in the effort to succeed. You can focus a little too much on material things."
